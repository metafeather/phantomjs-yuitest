# phantomjs-yuitest

The javascript scripts in *phantomjs-yuitest* enable the execution and gathering of [YUI Test][] results via PhantomJS.

## Highlights

* Compatible with the standard YUI Test runner, so you can use existing YUI Test HTML files and tests unchanged.
* Run a single test file.
* Run a list of multiple files or use a RegExp to find test files in a directory and report all results as a single **Test Run**.
* Run tests from the filesystem or hosted on other servers.
* Fast headless testing on [PhantomJS][], a full featured WebKit browser with native support for
various web standards: DOM handling, CSS selector, JSON, Canvas, and SVG.
* Run the same tests in exactly the same manner in a browser for easy test debugging.
* Command line options for CI server integration.
* Output reports in all supported YUI Test formats: [JUnit][], [TAP][], JSON, XML, and render a screenshot of each page.
* Runs on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows.

## Install

You need the PhantomJS browser installed on your system. You can download binaries for Mac OS X and Windows from
[the PhantomJS download section][].

You will also need a HTML page with YUI Test present and test cases setup to run *onload*, and which exposes the test runner as *window.Y.Test.Runner*.
(see *examples/unit_testing_file/unit.html*)

## Usage

To get a list of options and some examples run:

`phantomjs run-yuitest-multi.js --help`

## How it works

In a typical use case on a developers machine:

* The developer sets up a test page to host tests for the area of work under development
* The URL to the page is passed as the argument to the script
* PhantomJS loads the page and executes all tests, just as if loaded in a browser
* On completion the results are collected and output in the console

In a typical use case with lots of test files running from a continuous integration server:

* The script uses the supplied `testFilesMatch` RegExp to scan a `testDirectory` to find test files to execute
* Individual URLs for each test file are made from the files path in the directory and a supplied `testUrl` prefix
* Each URL is opened in PhantomJS and the page loads and executes all present tests, just as if loaded in a browser
* Listeners are attached the the YUI Test Runner to monitor tests as they run and provide feedback
* On completion of each page the results are collected and output in the console and reports saved to disk using the `testRunId` in the path
* Results are aggregated as a Test Run, including whether the page failed to load, timed out or was missing tests
* After all pages are loaded the total pass/fail result is shown and a summary saved
* The CI server (such as [Hudson][] or [Go][]) reads all the saved JUnit XML reports and displays the data such as individually failing tests with stack traces

## Alternatives

A minimal standalone script *run-yuitest-single.js* is supplied for comparison with the *run-qunit.js* and *run-jasmine.js* examples and as a starting point for custom development.
